The multi trainers were designed to mimic the Proving app (http://rl-competition.org/content/view/43/71/),
but instead of using the proving mdp's, the multi trainers run through all of the different training
mdp's. Each multi trainer (there is one for each environment/domain) runs the same number of steps on an
mdp as the proving software does(http://rl-competition.org/content/view/45/73/), however, this can be 
changed by modifying the source code.

Example for modifying MountainCar:
- Open MountaincarMultiTrainer.java (this file can be found in the src/ directory)
- Modify the value for mountaincarStepLimit to be the desired number of steps per
  mdp:
	//maximum number of steps per MDP
	int mountaincarStepLimit=100000;

Each environment has a run script to start it's multi trainer:
runHelicopter.bash
runMountaincar.bash
runRealTimeStrategy.bash
runTetris.bash

**There is no multi trainer for Keepaway yet **

Contained within the source code for these trainers is the code for running multiple
mdp's from within a single trainer.

To recompile the trainers:
$> make clean
$> make

NOTE:
You need to start your own agent!
