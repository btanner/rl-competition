The multi trainers were designed to mimic the Proving app, but instead of using
the proving mdp's, the multi trainers run through all of the different training
mdp's. Each multi trainer (there is one for each environment/domain) runs the same
number of steps on an mdp as the proving software does, however, this can be changed
by modifying the source code (in a trivial way).

Each environment has a run script to start it's multi trainer:
runHelicopter.bash
runMountaincar.bash
runRealTimeStrategy.bash
runTetris.bash

**There is no multi trainer for Keepaway yet **

Contained within the source code for these trainers is the code for running multiple
mdp's from within a single trainer.

To recompile the trainers:
$> make clean
$> make

NOTE:
You need to start your own agent!
